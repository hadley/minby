<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of minby is to solve the common problem of finding the minimum of a variable broken down by a group. To save you even more time, it includes a precomputed dataset giving the answer to one of the most important data science questions of 2022: what is the minimum of mpg by cyl?

## Installation

You can install the development version of minby like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("hadley/minby")
```

## Example

```{r example}
library(minby)
min_mpg_by_cyl

mtcars |> min_by(cyl, c(vs, am))
mtcars |> min_by(where(is.numeric), cyl)
```
